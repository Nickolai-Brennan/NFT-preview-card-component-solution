## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project allowed me to practice CSS custom properties and Flexbox layouts. I also experimented with hover effects and transitions. Here's an example of the hover effect I implemented:

- css
container img:hover
  transform: rotate(180deg);
  transition-duration: 3s;

### What I learned

In future projects, I plan to focus more on creating responsive designs and exploring CSS Grid for layout management. I also aim to refine my hover and transition effects for a smoother user experience.
